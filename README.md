# ReforestSuitability
## Challenge: Identifying Suitable Areas for Reforestation
### Objective:
Using spatial data, identify the most suitable areas for reforestation within a given region based on specific criteria like soil type, slope, elevation, and land cover.

### Data Requirements:
  1. **Land cover data** (e.g., satellite imagery or land use classification maps).
  2. **Digital Elevation Model (DEM)** for slope and elevation analysis.
  3. **Soil data** for soil types and quality.
  4. **Boundaries of the region of interest** (shapefiles or GeoJSON).
<hr>

### Steps to Solve:
1. Data Preprocessing:
    - Load spatial data (e.g., GeoTIFF, shapefiles) into Python (with `geopandas`/`rasterio`) or R (`sf`/`raster`).
    - Reproject all data into the same coordinate reference system (CRS).
    - Clip the data to the region of interest.

3. Analysis Criteria:
- Define reforestation suitability criteria:
  - **Slope**: Gentle slopes (e.g., less than 15°).
  - **Elevation**: Suitable elevation range (e.g., 100–1500 meters).
  - **Land cover**: Exclude urban or water bodies, focus on degraded lands.
  - **Soil**: Select soil types with high fertility or erosion resistance.

3. Spatial Analysis:
  - **Slope Calculation**: Derive slope from DEM using tools like `terrain` in R or `scipy.ndimage` in Python.
  - **Mask Layers**: Use binary masks to filter areas meeting criteria (e.g., land cover = degraded land).
  Combine masks using logical operations to identify suitable areas.

4. Visualization:
  - Create maps of the suitability layers and the final reforestation zones.
  - Highlight the best areas for reforestation in the output map.

5. Output:
  - Export the final suitability map as a GeoTIFF or shapefile.
  - Generate summary statistics (e.g., total area suitable for reforestation).

### Optional Extensions:
- Perform **cost analysis** by incorporating accessibility (e.g., distance to roads).
- Use **machine learning** for land cover classification from satellite images (e.g., Sentinel-2 data).
- Develop an **interactive map** with R Shiny or Python’s Dash/Streamlit to visualize the results.
